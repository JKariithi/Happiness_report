## About the Data

The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.

### Overview of the Columns in the data set
- *Overall rank* – Indicates a country’s position compared to others based on its happiness score (lower rank = higher happiness).
- *Country or region* – The specific nation or territory being evaluated.
- *Score* – The happiness score itself, which combines all the other factors.
- *GDP per capita* – Reflects the average income level; higher income generally allows for better living conditions and contributes positively to happiness.
- *Social support* – Measures if people have someone to rely on in times of trouble, which strongly boosts well-being.
- *Healthy life expectancy* – Represents how long people live in good health, contributing to a more fulfilling and worry-free life.
- *Freedom to make life choices* – Captures how free people feel to make decisions about their lives, which empowers a sense of control and happiness.
- *Generosity* – Based on donations and helping others; giving can increase one’s own sense of purpose and social connectedness.
- *Perceptions of corruption* – Reflects trust in government and society; lower corruption often means more fairness and stability, which improves happiness.
